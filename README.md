<p>Over this last summer I spent some time sitting in the pool, staring through the water at the shifting forms below. The sun interacts with the surface of the water like a liquid prism, creating bands of light and spots of darkness in an ever-changing, never-repeating pattern that flows smoothly. The inspiration for this program came from observing these ***caustic patterns***, and lets you experiment with different waves, vary the refractive incicies, and adjust the angle of the incoming light.</p>

<h2>A Bit About Light</h2>
<p>For the purposes of this program, and is standard in classical optics, we can treat light as a series of rays. These rays travel in straight lines unless they interact with a surface of some kind. In the field of optics, a surface is really just the boundary between two mediums with different refractive indicies (a larger refractive index roughly means light bends more). This could be the boundary between the air water, between water and a mirror, or even between air of differing densities. If two mediums have the same refractive index, then there is no surface to interact with.</p>
<p>Whenever a ray of light strikes a surface, one of three things can happen:
  
  1) It is absorbed, terminating the ray
  2) It is reflected, redirecting the ray away from the surface
  3) It is refracted, bending the ray as it passes through the surface
</p>
Neglecting the dependence on wavelength and other minor factors, the angle by which a ray is bent when refracted (not curved, but bent like a corner) is determined by two main factors: 
  the refeactive indicies of the materials, and the angle between the incoming ray and the surface. 
These variables are sufficient to determine the final trajectory of each light ray, and by following these rays until they strike the floor (z = 0) we can map each input ray to a point on the x-y plane. This is what gives way to the caustic patterns that one sees in pools and many other places.
